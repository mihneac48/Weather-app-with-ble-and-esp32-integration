#Weather app with BLE and ESP32 integration
##Description
This project implements a BLE-based distance estimation system between an ESP32 and an Android application using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). 
The Android app connects to the ESP32 via Bluetooth Low Energy, continuously reads the RSSI value, estimates the distance, and displays it using proximity indicators.
The estimated distance is then sent back in real time to the ESP32 for further processing.
##Key features
- BLE connection between Android and ESP32
- Real-time RSSI monitoring
- Distance estimation based on signal strength
- Proximity indicators in the app 
- Two-way BLE communication
##Technologies used
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- ESP32 (Arduino IDE)
- Android (Java/Kotlin in Android Studio)
- RSSI-based Distance Estimation
